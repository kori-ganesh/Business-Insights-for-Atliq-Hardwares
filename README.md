# 📊 AtliQ Hardwares – SQL to Business Insights

## 🧩 About the Project
This project is a business analytics case study based on AtliQ Hardwares (an imaginary company), completed as part of the **Codebasics Resume Project Challenge**.

AtliQ Hardwares is a fast-growing computer hardware manufacturer, but leadership faced difficulty in making quick, data-informed decisions due to limited actionable insights. 

The goal of this project was to analyze data using **SQL** and translate findings into clear business insights that support decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
The analysis focused on answering practical business questions such as:

* Where is the company over-dependent on customers or segments?
* Are product expansions actually translating into revenue growth?
* Do discounts really drive sales performance?
* Which segments and time periods need better planning or review?

The emphasis was not just on querying data, but on understanding what the data says about the business.

## 🔍 Key Insights
Some of the important insights uncovered include:

* **Customer Concentration:** A small group of customers contributes to a majority of sales, creating concentration risk.
* **Product Growth:** Product count has increased year over year, but not all segments convert growth into revenue.
* **Manufacturing Efficiency:** Certain segments have high SKU counts but low efficiency, indicating possible over-manufacturing.
* **Pricing Strategy:** Uniform discounting across top customers reduces pricing flexibility and may impact margins.
* **Sales Trends:** Sales show recurring weak periods, though recovery in specific months highlights execution opportunities.
